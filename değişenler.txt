What changed?

1 - Since 25.04.2023 Amazon changed default settings for newly created buckets. The ACL on buckets
 was considered as wrong practice (here is some nice post about that). To discourage using them the
 option BucketOwnerEnforced started to be the default one.

2.BucketOwnerEnforced - Access control lists (ACLs) are disabled and no longer affect permissions.
The bucket owner automatically owns and has full control over every object in the bucket.
The bucket only accepts PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or bucket owner full control ACLs, 
such as the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the
XML format.

$ aws s3api get-bucket-ownership-controls --bucket "${bucket_name}"

{
    "OwnershipControls": {
        "Rules": [
            {
                "ObjectOwnership": "BucketOwnerEnforced"
            }
        ]
    }
}

2 - Without BlockPublicPolicy we won't be able to set public access to the bucket. In case of acl 
authenticated-read (not 100% sure thought) here we should set RestrictPublicBuckets to false as well.

3 - For public or write acl, policy needs to be changed accordingly (PutObject)

Of course nothing stops you for using ACL, what you need to do is set BucketOwnerPreferred or 
ObjectWriter for your bucket.
